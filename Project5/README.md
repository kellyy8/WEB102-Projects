# Web Development Project 5 - *Cat Island's Stats on Cats!*

Submitted by: **Kelly Yu**

This web app: **fetches data from an API for a random set of cats (e.g.,breeds and origins) that users can filter through via buttons or a search bar (text input).**

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **The list displays a list of data fetched using an API call**
